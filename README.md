## 💀 What is this cursed thing?

**Endternet** is an interactive apocalypse simulator that shows you what the internet's final moments would look like. When you open the site, it slowly starts breaking down — elements glitch, colors invert, fake errors pop up, and you have to desperately try to "save the internet" before time runs out.

It's part game, part art piece, part existential crisis. **And it's 100% chaos.**

---

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Visual Mayhem
- **Glitch effects** that make reality question itself
- **Color inversions** when you least expect them
- **CSS animations that "die"** mid-execution
- **Static noise** overlay for that authentic apocalypse feel
- **Elements that melt, shake, spin, and break** physics

### 🖥️ Terminal Console
A fake terminal where you can type commands like:
- `save.internet();` — Attempt to save the internet (50% success rate)
- `reboot_meme_system();` — Reboot the meme database (always works)
- `hack.everything();` — Hack the mainframe that doesn't exist
- `status` — Check how screwed you are

### 🚨 Fake Error Popups
Random JavaScript alerts that pop up to haunt you:
- "404: Hope not found"
- "System overheating due to too many cat memes"
- "Reality.dll has stopped responding"
- "Cannot find keyboard. Press F1 to continue."

### ⏱️ Countdown Timer
**5 minutes until total internet collapse.**  
Can you save it before time runs out?

### 🎮 Interactive Chaos
- **Mouse movements** trigger destruction
- **Scrolling** causes random glitches
- **Clicking** spawns floating error messages
- **Button presses** have unpredictable consequences

### 🎬 Epic Ending Scene
When time runs out, the page fades to static, then reveals:
```

You survived the Endternet.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **HTML** — The skeleton of the apocalypse
- **CSS** — For animations that shouldn't work but do
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — No frameworks, no libraries, just raw chaos
- **Canvas API** — For static noise effects
- **Pure suffering** — The secret ingredient

### Why no frameworks?

Because when the internet dies, your React app won't save you. **Only raw HTML/CSS/JS survives the apocalypse.**

## 🎯 How to Experience the Chaos

1. Open `index.html` in any browser
2. Watch as everything slowly falls apart
3. Try to "fix" things with the buttons
4. Type commands in the terminal
5. Panic
6. Survive (or don't)

**No build steps. No npm install. Just open and suffer.**

## 🎮 Interactive Elements

| Button | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| 🚨 PANIC | Makes everything worse (as expected) |
| 🔧 FIX INTERNET | 70% chance to help, 30% to break more |
| ⚡ REBOOT | Actually helps! +20 health |
| 💀 ??? | Cursed. Don't press it. (You will anyway) |

## 🐛 Chaos Log (Bugs That Became Features)

1. **Bug #1:** Terminal wouldn't close when clicked  
   **Fix:** Made it reopen automatically. "Terminal cannot be closed. Nice try."

2. **Bug #2:** Glitch effects were too subtle  
   **Fix:** Made them 10x more aggressive. Reality is optional now.

3. **Bug #3:** Error popups spawned infinitely  
   **Fix:** Now closing one popup spawns two more sometimes. It's a feature.

4. **Bug #4:** Health decreased too fast  
   **Fix:** Added "Fix" button. Now users have hope. (False hope, but still)

5. **Bug #5:** The static noise crashed on mobile  
   **Fix:** Kept it. Chaos doesn't care about mobile optimization.

6. **Bug #6:** Color inversions were nauseating  
   **Fix:** Made them more nauseating. This is the apocalypse, not a spa.

7. **Bug #7:** ASCII art didn't render properly  
   **Fix:** Chose a different ASCII art. Problem solved.

- It's not a tool, it's an **experience**
- Meta commentary on web decay and digital mortality

### ✅ Execution
- Fully functional interactive chaos
- Polished glitch effects
- Terminal with working commands
- Dynamic health/timer system
- Proper ending sequence

### ✅ Technical Complexity
- Canvas manipulation for static noise
- Complex CSS animations and keyframes
- Event-driven chaos system
